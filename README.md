# Next.js Dynamic Imports and Data Fetching Methods

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using dynamic imports within a Next.js component that also utilizes `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`. The bug results in unexpected rendering behavior or errors, and this repository provides a minimal reproducible example, along with the solution.

## Problem Description

The core issue lies in the interplay between asynchronous component loading (through dynamic imports) and the synchronous data fetching methods (`getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`).  When these are combined improperly, Next.js may not handle the loading sequence correctly, leading to incomplete rendering or runtime errors.

## Solution

The provided solution demonstrates a proper method of incorporating dynamic imports within a data-fetching component. This avoids race conditions and ensures consistent rendering.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the rendering behavior of the buggy example and the corrected example.
